# Projects-Starter-Kit
What is the first application you do usually when getting started? It's more or less something close involving concepts similar to applications like To-Dos, MovieDBs, and so on, this is an open-source repository for project starters in different languages / frameworks.

## Getting started :
This is a collaborative open source repository for project starters / helpers from scratch, till: Well let's say _advanced_.

  - ## What to do currently?

    Right as of now, people who are well versed in the topics can start pushing in their comfortable language / framework. For the people who are beginners, worry not, you can do too, and if you have doubts, raise it as issues. The syntax and instructions are given [here](/contributing.md) for pushing code.

    Important points to keep in mind with the repository flow: 
    * Each framework / language gets a dedicated branch and is inside a folder.
    * All these folders [Example - VueJS](https://github.com/Gurubalan-GIT/Projects-Starter-Kit/tree/vue-js) will be reflected in the master branch.
    * Keep it clean and for more guidelines refer [here](/contributing.md).      

    You guys can follow the file structure which is just a template idea for now, so you know where to push what, but you have more topics? A different lanugage? No problem. Feel free to create and add new stuff.

    ```
    Important : Do update your @Username links in the contributors section!
    ```
    If any problems arrive communicate through the group or through Issues as well. Happy coding, guys! 

    ```
    Important: If you want to push something do keep it a practice to create a new branch and merge them after a pull request. This way other people can merge/review your work and also avoids conflicts with other users also in the same branch. Makes the working tree clean.
